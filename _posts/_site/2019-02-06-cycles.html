<p>Almost two years ago, I promised a series of three posts about version control.
The first two (<a href="https://jneem.github.io/merging/">here</a> and
<a href="https://jneem.github.io/pijul/">here</a>) introduced a new (at the time)
framework for version control. The third post, which I never finished, was
going to talk about the datastructures and algorithms used in
<a href="https://pijul.com">pijul</a>, a version control system built around that new
framework. The problem is that pijul is a complex piece of software, and so I
had lots of trouble wrapping my head around it.</p>

<p>Two years later, I’m finally ready to continue with this series of posts (but
having learned from my earlier mistakes, I’m not going to predict the total
number of posts ahead of time). In the
meantime, I’ve written my own toy version control system (VCS) to help me understand
what’s going on. It’s called <a href="https://github.com/jneem/jp"><code class="highlighter-rouge">jp</code></a>, and it’s extremely
primitive: to start with, it can only track a single file. However, it is just barely
sophisticated enough to demonstrate the important ideas. I’m also doing my best to
make the code is clear and well-documented.</p>

<h1 id="graggles-can-have-cycles">Graggles can have cycles</h1>

<p>As I try and ease back into this whole blogging business, let me just start
with a short answer for something that several people have asked me (and which
also confused me at some point). Graggles (which, as described in the earlier
posts are a kind of generalized file in which the lines are not necessarily
ordered, but instead form a directed graph) are not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAGs</a>; that is, they can
have cycles. To see why, suppose we start out with this graggle</p>

<p><img src="../images/cycles_tikz_block_1.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The reason this thing isn’t a file is because there’s no prescribed order
between the “shoes” line and the “garbage” line. Now suppose that my wife and I
independently flatten this graggle, but in different ways (because apparently
she doesn’t care if I get my feet wet).</p>

<p><img src="../images/cycles_tikz_block_2.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Merging these two flattenings will produce the following graggle:</p>

<p><img src="../images/cycles_tikz_block_3.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Notice the cycle between “shoes” and “garbage!”</p>

<p>Although I was surprised when I first noticed that graggles could have cycles, if
you think about it a bit more then it makes a lot of sense: one graggle put a
“garbage” dependency on “shoes” and the other put a “shoe” dependency on “garbage,”
and so when you merge them a cycle naturally pops out.</p>
