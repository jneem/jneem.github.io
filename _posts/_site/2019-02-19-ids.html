<p>I’ve written quite a bit about the <em>theory</em> of patches and merging, but nothing
yet about how to actually implement anything efficiently. TODO…</p>

<h1 id="three-scales-of-size">Three scales of size</h1>

<p>Before getting to the juicy details, we have to decide what it means for things
to be fast. In a VCS, there are three different size scales that we need
to think about. From smallest to biggest, we have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The size of the <em>change</em>. Like, if we’re changing one line in a giant file,
then the size of the change is just the length of the one line that we’re
changing.</li>
  <li>The size of the <em>current repository</em>. In the case of <code class="highlighter-rouge">jp</code> (which just tracks
a single file), this is just the size of the file.</li>
  <li>The size of the <em>history</em>. This includes everything that has ever been in
the repository, so if the repository has been active for years then the size
of the history could be much bigger than the current size.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first obvious requirement is that the size of a patch should be
proportional to the size of the change. This sounds almost too obvious to
mention, but remember the definition of a patch from <a href="https://??">this</a> post: a
patch consists of a source file, a target file, and a function from one to the
other that has certain additional properties. If we were to naively translate
this definition into code, the size of a patch would be proportional to the
size of the entire file.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a solved problem in the world of UNIX-style diffs (which I
mentioned all the way back in the <a href="https://??">first post</a>). The problem is to 
adapt the diff approach to our mathematical patch framework; for example, the
fact that our files need not even be ordered means that it doesn’t make sense
to talk about inserting a line “after line 62.”</p>

<p>The key to solving this turns out to be to unique IDs: give every line in the
entire history of the repository a unique ID. This isn’t even very difficult:
we can give every patch in the history of the repository a unique ID just by
hashing its contents. For each patch, we can enumerate the lines that it adds
and then for the rest of time, we can uniquely refer to those lines like “the
third line added by patch <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ar8f</code>.”</p>

<h1 id="representing-patches">Representing patches</h1>

<p>Once we’ve added unique ids to every line, it becomes pretty easy to encode
patches compactly. For example, suppose we want to describe this patch:</p>

<p><img src="../images/ids_tikz_block_1.svg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here, <code class="highlighter-rouge">dA</code> is the unique ID of the patch that introduced the to-do, shoes, and
garbage lines, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x5</code> is the unique ID of the patch that we want to describe.
Anyway, the patch is now easy to describe by using the unique IDs to specify
what we want to do: delete the line with ID <code class="highlighter-rouge">dA/1</code>, add the line with ID <code class="highlighter-rouge">x5/0</code>
and contents “* work”, and add an edge from the line <code class="highlighter-rouge">dA/2</code> to the line
<code class="highlighter-rouge">x5/0</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s have a quick look at how this is implemented in <code class="highlighter-rouge">jp</code>, by taking a peek at
the <a href="https://??">API docs</a>. Patches, funnily enough, are represented by the
<a href="https://??"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Patch</code></a> struct, which basically consists of metadata (author,
commit message, timestamp) and a list of <a href="https://??"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Change</code></a>s. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">Change</code>s
are the most interesting part, and they look like this:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">pub</span> <span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Change</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">NewNode</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">NodeId</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">contents</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Vec</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nb">u8</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="n">DeleteNode</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">NodeId</span> <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="n">NewEdge</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">src</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">NodeId</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">dest</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">NodeId</span> <span class="p">},</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In other words, the example that we saw above is basically all there is to it,
as far as patches go.</p>

<h1 id="antiquing">Antiquing</h1>

<p>I introduced unique IDs as a way to achieve compact representations of patches,
but it turns out that they also solve a problem that I promised to explain <a href="https://jneem.github.io/pijul/">two
years ago</a>: how do I compute the “most antique”
version of a patch? Or equivalently, if I have some patch but I want to apply
it to a slightly different repository, how do I know whether I can do that?
With our description of patches above, this is completely trivial: a patch can
only add lines, delete lines, or add edges. Adding lines is always valid, no
matter what the repository contains. Deleting lines and adding edges can be
done if and only if the lines to delete, or the lines to connect, exist in the
repository. Since lines have unique IDs, checking this is unambiguous.
Actually, it’s really easy because the line IDs are tied to the patch that
introduced them: a patch can be applied if and only if all the patch IDs that
it refers to have already been applied. For obvious reasons, we refer to these
as “dependencies”: the dependencies of a patch are all the other patches that
it refers to in <code class="highlighter-rouge">DeleteNode</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">NewEdge</code> commands. You can see this in action
<a href="https://github.com/jneem/jp/blob/ac45f45561457091cafd5d8c3ddbda0e1059a7e6/libjp/src/patch.rs#L192">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="applying-patches">Applying patches</h1>

<p>Now that we know how to compactly represent patches, how quickly can we apply
them?  To get really into detail here, we’d need to talk about how the state of
the repository is represented on disk (which is an interesting topic on its
own, but a bit out of scope for this post). Let’s just pretend for now that the
current state of the repository is stored as a graph in memory, using some
general-purpose crate
(like, say, <a href="https://docs.rs/petgraph/0.4.13/petgraph/"><code class="highlighter-rouge">petgraph</code></a>).
Each node in the graph needs to store the contents of the corresponding line,
as well as a “tombstone” saying whether it has been deleted
(see <a href="https://jneem.github.io/merging/">the first post</a>). Assuming we can
add nodes and edges in constant time (like, say, in <code class="highlighter-rouge">petgraph</code>), applying
a single change is a constant time operation. That means the time it takes
to apply the whole patch is proportional to the number of changes.
That’s the best we could hope for, so we’re done, right? What was even the
point of the part about three size scales?</p>

<h1 id="revenge-of-the-ghosts">Revenge of the ghosts</h1>

<p>Imagine you have a file that contains three lines:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>first line
second line
third line
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but behind the scenes, there are a bunch of lines that used to be there. So
<code class="highlighter-rouge">jp</code>’s representation of your file would look like:</p>

<p><img src="../images/ids_tikz_block_2.svg" alt="" /></p>
