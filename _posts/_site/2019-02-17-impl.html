<p>I’ve written quite a bit about the <em>theory</em> of patches and merging, but nothing
yet about how to actually implement anything efficiently. TODO…</p>

<h1 id="three-scales-of-size">Three scales of size</h1>

<p>Before getting to the juicy details, we have to decide what it means for things
to be fast. In a VCS, there are three different size scales that we need
to think about. From smallest to biggest, we have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The size of the <em>change</em>. Like, if we’re changing one line in a giant file,
then the size of the change is just the length of the one line that we’re
changing.</li>
  <li>The size of the <em>current repository</em>. In the case of <code class="highlighter-rouge">jp</code> (which just tracks
a single file), this is just the size of the file.</li>
  <li>The size of the <em>history</em>. This includes everything that has ever been in
the repository, so if the repository has been active for years then the size
of the history could be much bigger than the current size.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first obvious requirement is that the size of a patch should be
proportional to the size of the change. This sounds almost too obvious to
mention, but remember the definition of a patch from <a href="https://??">this</a> post: a
patch consists of a source file, a target file, and a function from one to the
other that has certain additional properties. If we were to naively translate
this definition into code, the size of a patch would be proportional to the
size of the entire file.</p>

<p>Of course, this is a solved problem in the world of UNIX-style diffs (which I
mentioned all the way back in the <a href="https://??">first post</a>). The problem is to 
adapt the diff approach to our mathematical patch framework; for example, the
fact that our files need not even be ordered means that it doesn’t make sense
to talk about inserting a line “after line 62.”</p>

<p>The key to solving this turns out to be to unique IDs: give every line in the
entire history of the repository a unique ID. This isn’t even very difficult:
we can give every patch in the history of the repository a unique ID just by
hashing its contents. For each patch, we can enumerate the lines that it adds
and then for the rest of time, we can uniquely refer to those lines like “the
third line added by patch <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ar8f</code>.”</p>
